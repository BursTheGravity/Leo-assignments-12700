#number = input()
number = 12
i = 2
while i < number:
    if number % i == 0:
        print (i)
    i = i + 1

This code will print out all of the factors of 12 between 2 and 11.
% returns the remainder of the two numbers, and the while loop checks whether i is less than the number
By printing i whenever the remainder is 0, this code will return all factors of 12 between 2 and 11
